We are applying and further developing recent substantial innovations in non-equilibrium quantum field theory for ultracold atomic gases. The functional field theory methods involve non-perturbative approximation schemes which recently have shown, by comparison with exact results, to excellently describe the far-from-equilibrium long-time dynamics of systems, even for strong interparticle forces.

Gorceix group	http://www-lpl.univ-paris13.fr:8082/	Université Paris Nord / CNRS	France		48.956155	2.341454	Exp	Our experiment creates dipolar Bose Einstein Condensates (BECs) of Cr atoms. In the last decade, the study of such ultracold atom gases has become an interdisciplinary and fascinating field. The realization of degenerate quantum gases opens the way to perform fundamental studies in quantum physics with an almost ideal dilute system displaying tunable properties (density, temperature, interaction strength, ...). This model system can be studied in a highly versatile environment since confining potentials can be tailored at will. Furthermore, since the analysis protocols benefit from the reliability of the laser spectroscopy techniques, the comparison between experimental outcomes and theoretical predictions is much sounder than what is usually met in condensed matter.                To date the available atomic quantum gases are made of atoms interacting through isotropic short-range potentials. The long-range anisotropic dipole-dipole interaction between atoms carrying a large magnetic moment is expected to induce a wealth of new properties. For example, a supersolid phase arises when a dipolar quantum gas is transfered  in a 2D lattice.        The magnetic dipole moment of chromium in the ground state is 6µB. Due to this exceptionally large dipole moment, chromium degenerate gases represent ideal systems to investigate quantum dynamics under the influence of dipolar interactions.        As a first stage to reach degeneracy, we set up a magneto-optical trap for the most abundant bosonic isotope 52Cr and for the fermionic isotope 53Cr. The two isotopes can be trapped separately as well as simultaneously producing a cold dipolar boson-fermion mixture. We studied the collisional properties of these cold gases. In a second stage, several millions 52Cr atoms are optically trapped at the focus of a powerful infrared laser at a temperature on the order of 100µK. Finally, we evaporatively cool the trapped 52Cr atoms down to degeneracy.        We have studied the collective excitations of the chromium BEC and demonstrated the impact of the anisotropic dipole-dipole interactions on the frequencies of the low-energy collective vibration modes of the trapped BEC. In a further set of experiments, we have studied S=3-spin dynamics using our Cr-BECs either in 3D or in restricted 2D and 1D geometries. At very low magnetic fields, spontaneous demagnetization occurs which enables the study of the S=3-spinor physics.        We plan to reach degeneracy for the fermionic isotope 53Cr , and to create strongly correlated systems, by extending our current experiments on the loading of our condensates into optical lattices. This will meet the current burst of interest in the statistical physics of such systems related to the field of quantum magnetism and will open new avenues for the processing of quantum information.

In particular, the recent development of high-energy ultrashort-pulse laser technology (in large part by the research group I co-lead with Professor Murnane) allows generation of coherent extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) and soft-X-ray bursts of femtosecond (10-15 sec) and even attosecond duration. (For comparison, the ratio of 1 femtosecond to 1 second is about the same as the ratio of 1 second to 30 million years.) The time scales probed by these light pulses correspond to those of chemical reactions and dynamic processes in semiconductors. Thus short-pulse short-wavelength light provides researchers with a unique tool to observe specific atoms, leading to a deeper understanding of the microscopic mechanisms. In recent years, our group has developed a variety of new techniques to efficiently upconvert ultrashort laser pulses coherently into the EUV and soft-X-ray regions of the spectrum.

Atoms in optical lattices are analogous to electrons in solid state crystals. Their big advantage is that these "artificial crystals of light" are perfectly clean and highly controllable. Therefore, they are ideal for exploring a whole range of fundamental phenomena that are extremely difficult — or impossible — to study in traditional condensed matter systems. My goal is to study how to control and manipulate these systems to engineer different quantum phases such as superfluids, insulators, quantum magnets, and topological matter.

In one project, I work on non-destructively measuring and canceling out the quantum fluctuations in the collective spin state of an ensemble of laser-cooled 87Rb atoms in a high-finesse optical cavity. By learning how to minimize the effect of quantum noise in this type of system, I hope to advance the precise measurements required for atomic clocks and in searches for permanent electric dipole moments in atoms and molecules.

Concerning quantum gases we are interested in physics of BEC-BCS crossover, dynamics of superfluid vortices, quantum turbulence, hydrodynamics and viscosity.        In the case of nuclear systems we are interested in large amplitude nuclear dynamics and in particular        microscopic description of fission/fusion, induced fission and low energy nuclear reactions.        We use mainly the following theoretical tools:        Path Integral Monte Carlo approach, Density Functional Theory (static and time-dependent).        Computational tools: In order to address certain questions concerning strongly interacting quantum systems one needs (super)computers. We use both CPU machines which allow for a massively parallel computing, as well as those with hybrid architecture (CPUs + GPUs).

My group is exploring molecular dynamics using exquisitely sensitive absorption-measurement techniques developed in JILA. We also use high-sensitivity techniques to define ultrastable optical frequency standards, currently being explored for their use in metrology, communications, and high-precision measurements such as in NASA's space-borne interferometers. The use of ultrafast lasers has revolutionized the field of optical frequency metrology, and we are actively pursuing research related to the concept and application of this novel field.

We study the thermodynamics of weakly-interacting Bose and Fermi superfluids (alkali-metal atoms like rubidium, sodium and lithium, but also atomic hydrogen) trapped in magnetic or magneto-optical traps. We analyze single-particle and collective elementary excitations by numerically solving both Bologliubov-de Gennes and Popov equations. Moreover, we investigate dynamical properties of Bose-Einstein condensates by using the time-dependent 3D Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which describes the macroscopic wave-function (order parameter) of the Bose condensate.                Presently we are investigating the dynamics (collective excitations and free expansion) of a two-component Fermi gas in the BCS-BEC crossover and the formation of solitons in atomic mixtures of bosons and fermions. In particular, we are developing a reliable density functional for the unitary Fermi gas (infinite scattering length) at zero and finite teperature.                We are planning to start the analysis of the condensate properties of p-wave Fermi atoms and d-wave superconductors in the BCS-BEC crossover both in two and three dimensions.

Schmelcher group	http://photon.physnet.uni-hamburg.de/ilp/schmelcher/	Center for Optical Quantum Technologies - University of Hamburg	Germany		53.577425	9.887146	Theory	The group explores several complementary aspects of ultracold physics.        The electronic structure and quantum dynamics of ultracold Rydberg atoms and molecules including their dressing in light fields and the coherent excitation dynamics in multi-trap arrays represents one focus. To develop a deep understanding of the mechanisms of quantum and in particular tunneling dynamics is our goal in case of strongly correlated bosons in low-dimensional traps including optical lattices and waveguides. Ultracold scattering in low-dimensions leads to novel interaction properties of atoms with an immediate impact on the corresponding many-body systems. Confinement-induced resonances and molecules formation as well as confinement-induced transparency are examples. We study nonlinear excitations of Bose-Einstein condensates such as solitons and vortices including their stability, structure and dynamics. Formation of ultracold molecules and steering their dynamics via external electric fields such as quantum control of photoassociation processes open the door to a quantum state selective chemical reactions dynamics.		theory
